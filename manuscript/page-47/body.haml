      %em If this ever becomes mainstream, the whole thing will come crashing down. The kind of people that *DO* rob, abuse, rape and murder people will start using these systems, and that will spread legitimate fear, corrupting the whole thing.

Some platforms act on this data to weed out the bad users (both buyers or sellers). For example, you’ll never see an Uber driver with a rating lower than three stars. Uber filters these drivers out, so customers don’t have to sift through driver reviews before getting a ride. On the flip side, riders are also rated, so drivers can feel safe with their pickups too.
