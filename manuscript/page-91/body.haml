    %h3 2. Seller/Supplier Metrics
    %p Supplier metrics are categorized into general and engagement KPIs, for example:
    %h5 General KPIs
    %ul
      %li Number of suppliers
      %li Suppliers growth rate
      %li Number of listings (in a services marketplace, this is not applicable so perhaps consider the number of active suppliers at a specific time instead).
      %li Listings growth rate
      %li Average listing price
      %li CAC
    %h5 Engagement KPIs on the supplier side
    %p Engagement KPIs are most important to the supplier side, so make sure you track these at the very least:
    %ul
      %li Cohort analysis: percentage of suppliers still active 1 month and/or 1 year after signing up
      %li GMV retention: average percentage of Month 1 GMV generated by suppliers in Month 12
      %li Concentration: percentage of revenue generated by the top 20% suppliers
      %li Net promoter score (NPS)
