    %h3 4. Measuring Liquidity
    %p The first marketplace in a category to reach liquidity wins (it’s winner takes all: we’ll discuss this further in Chapter 7, Working with Investors).

    %p Liquidity is the reasonable expectation of selling something you list or finding what you’re looking for. Liquidity indicates how successful the marketplace is for sellers and buyers. How long does it take to make a transaction? What percentage of goods or services are purchased daily?
