    %p Ultimately, we invest in smart founders â€” ones who are incredibly passionate, ambitious, and talented. But these founders are also data-driven, no matter how early the company is.

In fact, the founders we have been most impressed with have been able to present their data quickly and communicate insights clearly.

    %p The main multiple we like to use for marketplace businesses is GMV. Our rule of thumb is that marketplaces at scale are valued at roughly 1x annualized GMV (typically about 6-8x annual revenue). These are for marketplaces that are growing fast and are category leaders.
    %p Our assumptions for this valuation:
    %ul
      %li Scale: > $1b GMV
      %li YoY growth of at least 30%
      %li Take rate of about 10-15%
